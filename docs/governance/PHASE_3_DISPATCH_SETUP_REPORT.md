## Decision

`PHASE-3-DISPATCH-SETUP: COMPLETED — READY FOR EXECUTION`

This is a setup decision only. No Workflow or Check was dispatched.

## Completed

1. Added `.github/workflows/phase-3-source-only-dispatch.yml`.
2. Limited the trigger to manual `workflow_dispatch` with exact `target_sha` input.
3. Restricted execution to `agent/phase-a-source-of-truth` and required the input SHA to equal the selected branch commit.
4. Exposed only `verify:source`, `verify:ci`, `verify:release`, `test:unit`, `test:security` and `test:contracts`.
5. Set `permissions: contents: read`, `persist-credentials: false`, no Environment and no secret references.
6. Added one concurrency group per target SHA and cancellation as the kill switch.
7. Kept Preview, Production-readonly, disposable migrations, PR #170 and all write/AI/media operations outside this mechanism.
8. Updated `PHASE_3_ACTIVATION_GATE.md` and `PROJECT_HANDOFF.md`.

## No-write review

The dispatch definition contains no Supabase/database, Production, AI, Storage-write, publishing, scheduling, webhook or outbound-messaging credential or command. Package installation and source checks are runner-local and do not authorize application-side remote writes.

## Limitation

No claim is made that GitHub has accepted or run this branch-only Workflow. If manual dispatch is unavailable because of repository/default-branch behavior, the Gate requires an independently approved isolated runner with identical commands; otherwise execution fails closed.

## Safety receipt

No Workflow, Check, script, test, build, Preview, deployment, Migration, Supabase/provider/Production connection, generation, write, Storage mutation, publishing, scheduling, setting, secret or PR metadata change occurred. `main` was not touched.

## Transition

`PHASE-3-SAFE-EXECUTION` requires a separate explicit instruction, a new exact target SHA and every Activation Gate control.
