## Decision

`GROWTH-OPERATING-FOUNDATION: APPROVED — EXECUTION GATED`

This document is the strategic operating basis for visibility, local discovery, lead capture, booking conversion, automation and controlled publishing. Approval of this foundation does not authorize account connection, credential creation, API calls, data writes, AI generation, scheduling or publishing. Each activation requires a separate registered operation and complete activation gate.

## Repository role

`swim-fluent-uae` is the public product and conversion plane: website, SEO, Local SEO, approved landing pages, chatbot interface, Lead/Booking entry points and provider adapters. All protected operations must be server-mediated, idempotent, concurrency controlled and auditable. Browser code may not hold provider, database, webhook-signing or publishing secrets.

## Strategic objectives

1. Increase qualified organic search visibility.
2. Increase local visibility in Abu Dhabi and relevant UAE service areas.
3. Improve Google Maps and Google Business Profile discovery and conversion.
4. Establish measurable SEO and Local SEO operating loops.
5. Coordinate controlled multi-channel content distribution.
6. Route every valid interaction into a traceable Lead or Booking path.
7. Connect chatbot, CRM and booking through server-enforced, idempotent operations.
8. Preserve rollback, attribution, privacy, approval and auditability across all channels.
9. Scale without coupling migrations, providers, publishing and product features in one release.

## Universal governance rules

- Deny by default. No channel is connected or activated merely because it is listed here.
- Every channel requires verified ownership, exact account/property IDs, named operator, independent approver, credential scope, expiry, kill switch, rollback and audit receipt.
- Credentials are server-side only and separated by provider and purpose.
- Read, draft, schedule, publish, reply, lead-create and booking-create are distinct operations and require separate authorization.
- No browser-held provider, service-role, webhook-signing or publishing secret.
- No automatic publishing before a successful draft-only and approval-only stage.
- No unreviewed AI output may be published or sent to a customer.
- Every inbound event must be authenticated, deduplicated, normalized, consent-aware and traceable to its source.
- Every write must be idempotent and concurrency controlled.
- Migrations are separate database-only PRs and may not be bundled with channel or feature work.
- Failures must stop safely without fallback to another provider, account or destination.
- `main`, Production, providers and customer data remain untouched until separate explicit activation.

## 1. Google Business Governance

Purpose: improve branded and service discovery, profile completeness, trust and conversion.

## 10. Scheduling and Publishing Governance

Purpose: publish the right approved asset to the right account and time with traceable state and safe recovery.

Required lifecycle:
`idea -> draft -> reviewed -> approved -> scheduled -> publishing -> published | failed | cancelled`

Required controls:
- content fingerprint and immutable approved version;
- channel/account/locale/slot-specific idempotency key;
- one active publish lease per channel/account/content/slot;
- timezone fixed to Asia/Dubai unless explicitly overridden;
- approval expiry and reapproval after material edits;
- preflight for credentials, media, links, claims, policy and destination;
- provider receipt and canonical published URL;
- cancellation and kill switch before dispatch;
- rollback is unpublish/delete only when policy and provider permit, otherwise correction with audit trail;
- no automatic reschedule or cross-channel fallback after failure.

Initial eligible stage: offline calendar and approval-state design. Provider scheduling and publishing remain frozen.

## Cross-channel lead and booking model

Every valid interaction should enter a normalized event envelope containing:
- source channel and account/property;
- campaign/content/landing-page identifiers;
- provider event ID and received time;
- consent and contact fields where supplied;
- intent classification and confidence;
- deduplication fingerprint;
- attribution fields and UTM data;
- processing status and audit receipt ID.

The conversion sequence is:
`interaction -> validated event -> deduplicated contact -> Lead -> qualification -> Booking request -> staff confirmation`

A social interaction must not create a confirmed booking automatically. Booking confirmation remains a controlled staff/server transition unless separately approved.

## Measurement framework

Primary outcomes:
- qualified organic sessions;
- Google Business/Maps calls, website clicks, direction requests and bookings;
- Abu Dhabi local query coverage and conversion;
- indexed high-quality landing pages and non-branded search growth;
- channel reach, engagement, qualified conversations and lead rate;
- Lead-to-Booking conversion and time to first response;
- publishing success/failure, duplicate prevention and approval latency.

Guardrails:
- complaint rate, opt-out rate, spam rate, policy violations, duplicate leads, duplicate posts, failed workflows, stale content and unattributed conversions.

## Activation sequence

1. Source-only verification and documentation.
2. Read-only account, profile, SEO, Maps, citation and analytics inventories.
3. Canonical identity, NAP, taxonomy, attribution and consent definitions.
4. Draft-only content and offline scheduling model.
5. Read-only provider insights connections, one provider at a time.
6. n8n dry-run/shadow workflows with synthetic data only.
7. Chatbot scripted evaluation, then read-only knowledge access.
8. CRM/Lead sandbox writes after separate database authorization.
9. Booking-request sandbox flow with staff confirmation.
10. One-channel manual-approved publish pilot.
11. Controlled scheduling pilot with low volume and immediate kill switch.
12. Gradual expansion only after measured PASS receipts.

## Frozen until separate decisions

- all provider credentials and account connections;
- AI generation and AI-powered chatbot tools;
- n8n execution and webhooks;
- CRM and Booking writes;
- Google Business/Maps mutations;
- social/video upload, scheduling, publishing and replies;
- Production database, Storage and migrations;
- bulk content creation, bulk location pages or cross-channel autopublishing;
- PR #170 combined AI/Migration scope and any reintroduction of archived Production-write/AI workflows.

## Final approval

This strategic plan is approved as the operating foundation for the project. It defines what must be built and how it must be governed. It does not activate any channel. Execution proceeds only through isolated scopes, exact target SHAs, registered operations, independent approvals and fail-closed activation gates.
