Document status: CURRENT
Authority: STAGE COMPLETION RECEIPT
Applies to: swim-fluent-uae
Last verified: 2026-07-23 (Asia/Dubai)

## Decision

`STAGE-01-SAFE-EXECUTION-BASELINE: COMPLETED — STOPPED BEFORE STAGE 02`

## Roles

- Owner / Operator: `AYMAN`
- Independent approver: `pixelreel2026`

## Completed controls

- approved the sequential ten-stage program;
- established a separate Gate for every stage;
- established fail-closed transition rules;
- established kill switch, rollback, audit, idempotency and concurrency requirements;
- fixed paid AI cost ceiling at `0`;
- fixed image generation ceiling at `0`;
- fixed video generation ceiling at `0`;
- prohibited automatic paid-provider fallback and unintended spend;
- preserved all Production, Supabase, Storage, publishing, scheduling, webhook, CRM and Booking writes behind later separate gates;
- required exact SHA, named roles and independent approval for every later operation.

## Audit receipt

- runtime executions: `0`;
- Workflows dispatched: `0`;
- provider connections: `0`;
- paid AI calls: `0`;
- generated images: `0`;
- generated videos: `0`;
- database / Supabase writes: `0`;
- Storage writes: `0`;
- publishing / scheduling actions: `0`;
- Production connections: `0`;
- main modifications: `0`.

PR #170 and archived Production-write/AI workflows remain frozen.

## Final state

`FAIL-CLOSED / NOT AUTHORIZED FOR STAGE 02`

Stage 2 `READ-ONLY INVENTORY` must not begin without a separate explicit instruction, a new target SHA and its own completed Gate.
