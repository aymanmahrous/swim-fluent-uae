## Decision

`PHASE-3-PREP: COMPLETED — READY FOR EXECUTION`

Operational display wording: `PHASE-3-PREP: COMPLETED — READY FOR SAFE EXECUTION`.

This means the two lowest-risk read-only operations are now registered and gated. It does not start or authorize `PHASE-3-SAFE-EXECUTION`.

## Completed

1. Added literal Registry operation `source-only-verification`.
2. Added literal Registry operation `preview-readonly-verification`.
3. Recorded Repository, read-only classification, allowed environment, approvals, checks, secrets scope, kill switch, rollback, audit receipt, idempotency, concurrency and status `ALLOWED-FOR-PHASE-3` for both operations.
4. Updated `PHASE_3_ACTIVATION_GATE.md` to recognize only those two operations for the first safe-execution attempt.
5. Updated `PROJECT_HANDOFF.md` with the preparation status and next gate.
6. Kept `verify:production-readonly`, Disposable migrations, PR #170 and all write/AI/media scopes outside these two operations.

## Remaining execution prerequisites

- a new exact 40-character target SHA after this report;
- selection of one literal operation;
- named Operator and independent approver;
- successful exact-SHA check receipts;
- approved Preview URL and verified `preview-readonly` secret inventory for Preview;
- authorized dispatch mechanism or isolated runner;
- time-bounded authorization, kill switch and audit receipt location.

## Safety receipt

No Workflow, check, script, test, build, Preview, deployment, Migration, Supabase/provider/Production connection, generation, write, publishing, Storage mutation, scheduling, setting, secret or PR metadata change occurred. `main` was not touched.

## Transition

`PHASE-3-SAFE-EXECUTION` may begin only after a separate explicit instruction and must fail closed if any Activation Gate control is absent.
