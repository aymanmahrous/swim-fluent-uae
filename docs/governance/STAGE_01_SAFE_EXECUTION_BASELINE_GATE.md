# Stage 01 — Safe Execution Baseline Gate

Document status: CURRENT
Authority: STAGE GATE
Applies to: swim-fluent-uae
Last verified: 2026-07-23 (Asia/Dubai)

## Stage identity

- Stage: `01-SAFE-EXECUTION-BASELINE`
- Owner / Operator: `AYMAN`
- Independent approver: `pixelreel2026`
- Allowed branch: `agent/phase-a-source-of-truth`
- Classification: governance-only / no runtime execution

## Required controls

- exact target SHA for any later execution;
- separate instruction for every later stage;
- repository read scope only unless separately approved;
- no provider credentials;
- no Supabase, database, Storage, publishing, webhook, CRM or Booking credentials;
- no paid AI provider;
- AI cost ceiling `0`;
- image generation ceiling `0`;
- video generation ceiling `0`;
- no automatic fallback, retry-to-paid, or trial conversion;
- one operation per approval;
- one active operation per repository + target SHA;
- complete audit receipt;
- fail closed on any missing control.

## Kill switch

Owner: `AYMAN`.

Method: cancel the run if one exists, disable dispatch or runner access, revoke any scoped credential, stop new claims and return the repository operation to `FAIL-CLOSED` while preserving receipts.

## Rollback

Stage 1 changes governance Markdown only. Rollback must use a new auditable branch commit; no force push or history rewrite. No remote provider state exists to reverse.

## Audit receipt

Record repository, branch, target SHA, stage, requester, operator, independent approver, start/completion time, files changed, check/run identifiers if any, cost actual, media-generation actual, kill-switch state, rollback result and final PASS/FAIL. Secret values are prohibited.

## Idempotency

Identity: repository + branch + stage number + exact document set + expected blob SHA. Repeating an unchanged Stage 1 request must not create duplicate documents or contradictory status.

## Concurrency

Lock: one active Stage 1 governance update per repository branch. File updates are sequential and expected-SHA protected.

## PASS conditions

PASS requires the ten-stage program, this Gate, a Stage 1 completion report, updated Handoff, zero runtime execution, zero provider connection, zero AI cost, zero generated images and zero generated videos.

## FAIL conditions

Any runtime execution, provider connection, write, publishing, scheduling, webhook, migration, paid AI call, image/video generation, missing approval, missing receipt or ambiguous status results in `FAIL-CLOSED`.

## Transition

PASS completes Stage 1 only. Stage 2 `READ-ONLY INVENTORY` remains blocked until a separate explicit instruction.
