# Safe Growth Ten-Stage Program

Document status: CURRENT
Authority: STRATEGIC OPERATING PROGRAM
Applies to: swim-fluent-uae

## Program decision

`SAFE-GROWTH-10-STAGE-PROGRAM: APPROVED — SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION ONLY`

The program is executed one stage at a time. A stage must be completed, documented, independently reviewed and returned to fail-closed before the next stage may begin. No stage starts automatically.

## Program roles

- Owner / Operator: `AYMAN`
- Independent approver: `pixelreel2026`
- Repository: `aymanmahrous/swim-fluent-uae`
- Branch: `agent/phase-a-source-of-truth`

A later stage may require additional Security, Release, Privacy, Database, Content or Provider approval. Missing approval fails closed.

## Permanent program prohibitions

The following are prohibited throughout all ten stages unless a later, separate governance amendment explicitly replaces this rule:

- image generation;
- video generation;
- paid AI provider use;
- automatic provider spend;
- unapproved trials that can convert to paid usage;
- automatic fallback to a paid model or provider;
- hidden media rendering, transcription, enhancement or generation charges;
- Production writes without an operation-specific gate;
- Supabase, Storage, publishing, scheduling, webhook, CRM or Booking writes without a separately approved stage operation;
- execution outside an exact target SHA and named repository branch.

Default AI cost ceiling: `0`.
Default media-generation ceiling: `0` images and `0` videos.

## Universal stage contract

Every stage must define and record:

1. exact scope and excluded scope;
2. exact repository, branch and target SHA;
3. Owner / Operator and Independent approver;
4. required checks and evidence;
5. allowed Environment and secret scope;
6. kill switch and named owner;
7. rollback / recovery plan;
8. audit receipt location;
9. idempotency identity;
10. concurrency lock identity;
11. maximum duration and expiry;
12. PASS and FAIL conditions;
13. explicit stop before the next stage.

Any missing, ambiguous, expired, skipped or unverified control causes `FAIL-CLOSED`.

## Stages

### 1. SAFE EXECUTION BASELINE

Status: `COMPLETED`.

Established the immutable safety contract, role separation, cost/media prohibition, approved dispatch boundary, receipts, rollback, kill switch, idempotency and concurrency rules. No provider or runtime execution.

### 2. READ-ONLY INVENTORY

Status: `STAGE-02-READ-ONLY-INVENTORY: COMPLETED — STOPPED BEFORE STAGE 03`.

Repository-grounded inventory completed for website/SEO/Local SEO evidence, Google Business/Maps documentation, social-channel evidence gaps, n8n artifacts, chatbot interfaces and CRM/Booking entry-point boundaries. External account data remained unavailable by design because no API call, provider login or Workflow was permitted.

Authoritative evidence:

- `docs/governance/STAGE_02_READ_ONLY_INVENTORY_GATE.md`
- `docs/governance/STAGE_02_READ_ONLY_INVENTORY_REPORT.md`

### 3. CONVERSION OPERATING MODEL

Status: `STAGE-03-CONVERSION-OPERATING-MODEL: COMPLETED — STOPPED BEFORE STAGE 04`.

The governed design now defines interaction sources, validated-event schema, contact/Lead/Booking-request schemas, validation, deduplication, UTM attribution, consent/privacy boundaries, state machines, human handoff, deterministic chatbot flow, n8n pseudo-flow, idempotency, concurrency, receipts and KPIs. No runtime, external read, API, provider, Workflow, n8n, chatbot, CRM or Booking operation occurred.

Authoritative evidence:

- `docs/governance/STAGE_03_CONVERSION_OPERATING_MODEL.md`

### 4. CONTENT CALENDAR (DRAFT-ONLY)

Status: `BLOCKED`.

Create offline text-only editorial planning, approval states, attribution and content fingerprints. No AI generation, images, video, upload, scheduling or publishing.

### 5. N8N SHADOW MODE

Status: `BLOCKED`.

Design and later validate synthetic-data, no-write workflows with bounded retries, replay protection, dead-letter behavior and zero Production credentials. No live webhook or provider mutation.

### 6. CHATBOT SCRIPTED EVALUATION

Status: `BLOCKED`.

Evaluate deterministic scripted conversations and handoff behavior without a paid AI provider, external tool writes, CRM writes or Booking confirmation.

### 7. SINGLE CHANNEL PILOT

Status: `BLOCKED`.

A separately approved pilot for one channel only, with one operation, strict volume limit, manual approval and immediate kill switch. Images, video generation and paid AI remain prohibited.

### 8. MULTI-CHANNEL EXPANSION

Status: `BLOCKED`.

Expand only after the single-channel pilot has complete PASS receipts. Each channel retains independent credentials, locks, approvals and rollback; no unsafe cross-channel fallback.

### 9. CRM & BOOKING INTEGRATION

Status: `BLOCKED`.

Introduce server-mediated, idempotent, concurrency-controlled Lead and Booking-request operations after separate Database/Security approval. Staff confirmation remains required.

### 10. MONTHLY GROWTH OPERATIONS REVIEW

Status: `BLOCKED`.

Review KPIs, attribution, failures, costs, permissions, receipts, content quality, local visibility and conversion. The review cannot activate a blocked operation by itself.

## Transition rule

A stage is eligible to start only after:

- the previous stage report says `COMPLETED`;
- the previous stage returned to fail-closed;
- a separate explicit instruction names the next stage;
- the next-stage Gate is complete;
- a new exact target SHA is selected.

## Current program state

`FAIL-CLOSED / NOT AUTHORIZED FOR STAGE 04`

Stage 04 must not begin automatically. PR #170 and archived Production-write/AI workflows remain frozen.
