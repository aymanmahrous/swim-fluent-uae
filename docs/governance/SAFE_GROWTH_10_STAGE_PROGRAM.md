# Safe Growth Ten-Stage Program

Document status: CURRENT
Authority: STRATEGIC OPERATING PROGRAM
Applies to: swim-fluent-uae
Last verified: 2026-07-24 (Asia/Dubai)

## Program decision

`SAFE-GROWTH-10-STAGE-PROGRAM: APPROVED — SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION ONLY`

Stages normally proceed sequentially. Stage 06 was explicitly authorized as a documentation-only dependency exception because Stage 05 has no authorized runner. This does not complete or bypass Stage 05 for any runtime purpose.

## Program roles

- Owner / Operator: `AYMAN`
- Independent approver: `pixelreel2026`
- Repository: `aymanmahrous/swim-fluent-uae`
- Branch: `agent/phase-a-source-of-truth`

## Permanent boundaries

- paid AI provider use: prohibited; cost ceiling `0`;
- generated images: prohibited; ceiling `0`;
- generated videos: prohibited; ceiling `0`;
- external API, Production, Supabase, Storage, publishing, scheduling, webhook, CRM or Booking writes require separate authority;
- missing or unverified controls fail closed.

## Stages

1. SAFE EXECUTION BASELINE — `COMPLETED`.
2. READ-ONLY INVENTORY — `COMPLETED`.
3. CONVERSION OPERATING MODEL — `COMPLETED`.
4. CONTENT CALENDAR (DRAFT-ONLY) — `COMPLETED`.
5. N8N SHADOW MODE — `BLOCKED — NO AUTHORIZED SHADOW RUNNER`.
6. CHATBOT SCRIPTED EVALUATION — `STAGE-06-CHATBOT-SCRIPTED-EVALUATION: COMPLETED — STOPPED BEFORE STAGE 07`.
7. SINGLE CHANNEL PILOT — `BLOCKED`.
8. MULTI-CHANNEL EXPANSION — `BLOCKED`.
9. CRM & BOOKING INTEGRATION — `BLOCKED`.
10. MONTHLY GROWTH OPERATIONS REVIEW — `BLOCKED`.

## Stage 05 preserved result

Stage 05 remains incomplete. No n8n execution occurred and no Shadow Receipt exists. Its report remains authoritative:

- `docs/governance/STAGE_05_N8N_SHADOW_MODE_REPORT.md`

## Stage 06 result

Stage 06 completed repository-only scripted scenario design for services, prices, locations, schedules, Booking Request boundaries, complaints, safety, child-data minimization, low-confidence handling, duplicate requests, cancellation/change and human handoff.

No chatbot runtime, provider, AI, CRM, Booking, Calendar, n8n, webhook, publishing or external operation occurred.

Authoritative evidence:

- `docs/governance/STAGE_06_CHATBOT_SCRIPTED_EVALUATION.md`

PR #170 and archived Production-write/AI workflows remain frozen.

## Current program state

`FAIL-CLOSED / NOT AUTHORIZED FOR STAGE 07`

Stage 07 requires a separate explicit instruction, a new target SHA and an operation-specific Gate. Stage 05 must continue to be reported as blocked.
