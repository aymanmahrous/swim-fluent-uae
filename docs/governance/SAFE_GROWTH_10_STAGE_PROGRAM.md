# Safe Growth Ten-Stage Program

Document status: CURRENT
Authority: STRATEGIC OPERATING PROGRAM

## Program decision

`SAFE-GROWTH-10-STAGE-PROGRAM: APPROVED — SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION ONLY`

Stages normally proceed sequentially. Stage 06 was authorized as a documentation-only dependency exception because Stage 05 has no authorized runner. Stage 07 was requested as a multi-surface extension, but the live pilot could not be authorized under a Single Channel stage with zero external calls and zero user-message transmission.

## Program roles

- Owner / Operator: `AYMAN`
- Independent approver: `pixelreel2026`
- Repository: `aymanmahrous/swim-fluent-uae`
- Branch: `agent/phase-a-source-of-truth`

## Permanent boundaries

- paid AI provider use: prohibited; cost ceiling `0`;
- generated images: prohibited; ceiling `0`;
- generated videos: prohibited; ceiling `0`;
- external API, Production, Supabase, Storage, publishing, scheduling, webhook, CRM or Booking writes require separate authority;
- user-message storage or transmission requires explicit Privacy and operation-specific authority;
- missing or unverified controls fail closed.

## Stages

1. SAFE EXECUTION BASELINE — `COMPLETED`.
2. READ-ONLY INVENTORY — `COMPLETED`.
3. CONVERSION OPERATING MODEL — `COMPLETED`.
4. CONTENT CALENDAR (DRAFT-ONLY) — `COMPLETED`.
5. N8N SHADOW MODE — `BLOCKED — NO AUTHORIZED SHADOW RUNNER`.
6. CHATBOT SCRIPTED EVALUATION — `COMPLETED — DOCUMENTATION ONLY`.
7. SINGLE CHANNEL PILOT — `BLOCKED — LIVE PILOT NOT AUTHORIZED; DESIGN PACKAGE COMPLETED`.
8. MULTI-CHANNEL EXPANSION — `BLOCKED`.
9. CRM & BOOKING INTEGRATION — `BLOCKED`.
10. MONTHLY GROWTH OPERATIONS REVIEW — `BLOCKED`.

## Stage 05 preserved result

Stage 05 remains incomplete. No n8n execution occurred and no Shadow Receipt exists.

## Stage 06 result

Stage 06 completed repository-only scripted scenario design. No chatbot runtime or external operation occurred.

- `docs/governance/STAGE_06_CHATBOT_SCRIPTED_EVALUATION.md`

## Stage 07 result

Stage 07 received a request covering website, Facebook Page Inbox, Instagram DM and WhatsApp Business. This conflicts with the Single Channel contract and requires external account configuration or message handling that was prohibited by the requested zero-call and zero-transmission limits.

A design package was completed for:

- approved scripted intents and reply rules;
- website, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp boundaries;
- human handoff and no-auto-booking controls;
- text-only Facebook/Instagram draft cadence;
- channel-specific future Gate requirements;
- kill switch, rollback and zero-effect receipts.

No channel was activated, connected, tested or used to transmit or store a user message.

Authoritative evidence:

- `docs/governance/STAGE_07_CHATBOT_PILOT_REPORT.md`

PR #170 and archived Production-write/AI workflows remain frozen.

## Current program state

`FAIL-CLOSED / NOT AUTHORIZED FOR STAGE 08`

Stage 07 live pilot remains incomplete. A retry must select exactly one channel, use a new exact Target SHA and provide an operation-specific Gate. Stage 08 must not begin automatically.
