## Current stage

`STAGE-03-CONVERSION-OPERATING-MODEL: COMPLETED — STOPPED BEFORE STAGE 04`

`SAFE-GROWTH-10-STAGE-PROGRAM: APPROVED — SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION ONLY`

The project completed Stage 03 as repository-only design work, returned to fail-closed and stopped. No later stage starts automatically.

## Completed Stage 03 design

The operating model defines:

- the governed conversion path from Interaction through Staff Confirmation;
- theoretical source-channel mapping;
- validated-event, Lead and Booking-request schemas;
- validation and deduplication rules;
- UTM and attribution mapping;
- consent, privacy and minimum-data boundaries;
- Lead and Booking-request state machines;
- human-handoff conditions;
- deterministic text-only chatbot flow;
- n8n pseudo-flow reserved for Stage 05;
- idempotency, concurrency, receipts and KPI definitions.

`swim-fluent-uae` remains the public product and conversion plane. The design maps future website, chatbot and channel events into controlled Lead and Booking-request candidates, but Stage 03 did not create or mutate live data.

## Runtime and external boundary

Stage 03 performed no:

- API or provider call;
- Workflow, n8n or chatbot runtime;
- Lighthouse, PageSpeed or Insights run;
- CRM or Booking write;
- Production, Supabase or Storage connection;
- publishing, scheduling or webhook;
- paid AI call;
- image or video generation.

PR #170 and archived Production-write/AI workflows remain frozen.

## Ten-stage order

1. SAFE EXECUTION BASELINE — completed.
2. READ-ONLY INVENTORY — completed.
3. CONVERSION OPERATING MODEL — completed.
4. CONTENT CALENDAR (DRAFT-ONLY) — blocked.
5. N8N SHADOW MODE — blocked.
6. CHATBOT SCRIPTED EVALUATION — blocked.
7. SINGLE CHANNEL PILOT — blocked.
8. MULTI-CHANNEL EXPANSION — blocked.
9. CRM & BOOKING INTEGRATION — blocked.
10. MONTHLY GROWTH OPERATIONS REVIEW — blocked.

## Safety receipt

External/API calls, Workflow executions, n8n executions, chatbot runs, CRM writes, Booking writes, paid AI calls, generated images/videos, publishing/scheduling/webhooks, Lighthouse/PageSpeed/Insights runs, Production/Supabase/Storage connections and `main` modifications were all `0`.

## Current safety state

`FAIL-CLOSED / NOT AUTHORIZED FOR STAGE 04`

Stage 04 requires a separate explicit instruction, a new exact target SHA and its own completed Gate.
